				Jakob Fugger of the Lily (German: Jakob Fugger von der Lilie) (6 March 1459 – 30 December 1525), 
				also known as Jakob Fugger the Rich or sometimes Jakob II, 
				was a major German merchant, mining entrepreneur and banker. 
				He was a descendant of the Fugger merchant family located in the Free Imperial City of Augsburg, 
				where he was born and later also elevated through marriage to Grand Burgher of Augsburg (German Großbürger zu Augsburg). 
				Within a few decades he expanded the family firm to a business operating in all of Europe. 
				He began his education at the age of 14 in Venice, which also remained his main residence until 1487. 
				At the same time he was a cleric and held several prebendaries, even though he never lived in a monastery. 
				Fugger is held to be one of the wealthiest individuals in modern history.

						Was a German professor of theology, composer, priest and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation.
						Luther was ordained to the priesthood in 1507. He came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church; 
						in particular, he disputed the view on indulgences. 
						Luther proposed an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences 
						in his Ninety-five Theses of 1517. 
						His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the 
						Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his 
						excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Holy Roman Emperor.

				Was an Italian explorer, navigator, and colonist who completed four voyages across the

				He led the first European expeditions to the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, 
				initiating the permanent European colonization of the Americas. 
				Columbus discovered the viable sailing route to the Americas, a continent that was then unknown to the Old World. 
				While what he thought he had discovered was a route to the Far East, 
				he is credited with the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans.

				Was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect and poet of the High Renaissance born in the Republic of Florence, 
				who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. 
				Considered by many the greatest artist of his lifetime, and by some the greatest artist of all time,
				his artistic versatility was of such a high order 
				that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, 
				along with his rival, the fellow Florentine and client of the Medici.
